Script to automatically renew plex ssl certificate using the Synology LetsEncrypt certificate.

Original script : https://github.com/zachg99/synology-plex-cert-autorenew

If you have a LetsEncrypt SSL certificate setup on your Synology it autorenews every 3 months. 
Whenever that certificate renews this will automatically update the certificate Plex is using. 
Just set it up to run daily in the task scheduler.
